## TITLE : Learning Module of Graph Theory üìÉ

<p>This project consist of a comprehensive learning module on graph theory, showcasing various types of graphs for users to explore. Upon selecting a graph, the module provides a detailed definition and highlights key properties of that specific graph, accompanied by relevant examples.
</p><p>Additionally, it has a separate plot area where users can create their own graphs. The system then displays key details about the graph, such as the number of edges, number of vertices, and degree of the graph.
 </p><p>Furthermore, the project highlights the real-life applications of graphs, underscoring the significance and relevance of this field in contemporary society.</p>
 
This Module includes the following Graphs:
<li>Complete graph	
  <li>Bipartite graph	<li>Wheel graph
<li>Complete Bipartite graph	<li>Hamiltonian graph	<li>Euler graph
<li>Trees	<li>Cycle Graph	<li>Splitting graph
<li>Planar graph	<li>Weighted graph	<li>Individual graph

üî∑ As a part of our academic course in Discrete Mathematics and Graph Theory during our third semester, my friend <a href= "https://github.com/venishaparmar">Venisha Parmar</a> and I collaborated on this project. We worked as a team of two members to complete this project.
